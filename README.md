# Credit-Risk-Modeling-using-Machine-Learning
Captstone Project by Nishant Sharma
This is a comprehensive comparion of some classification models used for credit risk prediction 


Steps followed->

1.Data analysis,visulization  and prepocessing 

2.Training benchamark superivised learning model(Logistic Regression)

4.A feed Forward Deep Nerual Netwrok was built and trained.

3.Training Ensemble methods(Random forest,Adaboost,Gradient boosted trees,weighted classifers)

4.Training Weighted Voting classifer of the above ensemble methods and tuning parameters for each algorithim usign GridSearch 10 fold cross validation.

5.Finally,Gradient Boosting with tuned parameters was select,accuracy achived-82.3%.
